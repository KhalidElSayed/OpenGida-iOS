Open Guida for iOS
===================

As part of the [Open Irekia project](http://open.irekia.net), the Basque
Government has released under the

This is an unofficial mirror of the software releases for the Open Gida iOS
mobile client.

The github repo contains just the files released plus this additional readme
made for Github. You can also read the [original README
